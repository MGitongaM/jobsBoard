        testimonialMessage:"So it's 1985, and I'm in Chicago, and I'm working with these churches, and with lots of laypeople who are much older than I am. They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor. That commitment is at the core of the Treaty, and it must be kept for all who fully abide by it. Some suggest that it isn't worth the effort - that we are fated to disagree, and civilizations are doomed to clash.",

        testimonialMessage:"And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns - this too widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding. And then another one. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. Not even close. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.",

This time we want to talk about the crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children and white children and Asian children and Hispanic children and Native American children. This time we want to talk about how the lines in the Emergency Room are filled with whites and blacks and Hispanics who do not have health care.",
